## 👋 Hello! My name is Lee. I'm a Site Reliability Engineer living in Nashville, Tennessee.

### Technical books I recently enjoyed:

- The Philosophy of Software Design by John Ousterhout
- Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann
- Tidy First? by Kent Beck
- The Joy of Agility by Joshua Kerievsky

I sometimes post notes on things I'm reading/watching/hearing over in my [margins repo](https://github.com/leejones/margins).
